## Description

This full-stack application is a personal note-taker that allows me to take notes and save them for later reference. Specifically, on application load, I can view previous notes, write a new note, and delete previous notes. Because it is a deployed server application on Heroku, I am able to use this application on the go on any device.

## Technologies

The main technology at play here (in my contribution) is express, which is used to create an instance of a server. Alongside this, node.js and many of its modules, namely filesystem and path, are used to handle execution of code in the server and interaction with my mock database.
